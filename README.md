## Sass Lib Starter 

This is a starter template to help you build and test Sass-based libraries. 

#### Libraries Used: 

- [true](https://github.com/oddbird/true) - Sass testing framework.
- [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) - Running True via Mocha allows you to test mixins
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) - Running and watch Sass files (both for your library and for testing)

## Installation 

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Do your stuff! 

## Usage

1. Write your Sass library in `scss/_your-lib.scss`. Import any partials if necessary.
2. Write your tests in `test/test.scss`
3. Voil√†!

Additional Note: You can also add `.scss` files in the `scss` folder if you wanted to create a resultant file for eyeballing the output (Check out `eyeballing.scss` for an example).
